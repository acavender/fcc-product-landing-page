            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This is just filler text, to test layout. At least <a href="http://doctoripsum.com">Doctor ipsum</a> is entertaining.</p>
            <p>It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Geronimo! No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. You are the only mystery worth solving. Brave heart, Clara. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember
            every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.</p>
            <p>I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Look at me. Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! I never know why. I only know who. Come along, Pond! Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. I once
            spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby Australian to Heathrow airport. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick.</p>
            <p>People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky.</p>

                <p>That's the trouble with regeneration. You quite never know what you're going to get. Dreams are important…never underestimate them. Adric? There's always something to look at if you open your eyes! You may disguise your features but you can never disguise your intent. Brave heart, Tegan. Sorry must dash! This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf. Well, I'm still not the man I used to be… thank goodness. Safety precaution. I'm allergic to certain gases in the praxis range of the spectrum. If the gas is present, the celery turns purple… I eat the celery. If nothing else, I'm sure it's good for my teeth.</p>

                That could blow a hole in the space-time continuum, the size of—actually, the exact size of Belgium. That's a bit undramatic, isn't it? 'Belgium'? Brave heart, Tegan. Well, it wouldn't be cricket. It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf. Sorry, must dash! For some people, small, beautiful events are what life is all about! Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation.</p>
